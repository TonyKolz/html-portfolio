<h1>The Best Movie According to Kolz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time!</h2>

<hr />

    <h3>Mission Impossible Series</h3> 
    <p>I love this movie because of the stunts and how well Tom Cruise portrays the character.</p>

    <h3>Rush Hour Series</h3>
    <p>Jackie Chan always make the stunts look real since he actually does them himself and co-starring with Chris Tucker makes it a great action comedy.</p>

    <h3>Terminator Series</h3> 
    <p>Arnold Schwazenneger is one of the greatest all time action movies actor and the movie terminator is one I can always watch over and over again considering I don't like watching movies for the second time.</p>
